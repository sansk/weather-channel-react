## Details

The project fetches the current weather data from [OpenWeather.org](openweathermap.org).
And displays all the details in `Metric` units.

The unix time and timezone from the API is used to calculate the local time and date which is displayed along with the location details.

## Build With

- React JS
- Styled Components
- React Hooks - useState, useRef & useEffect Only
- Openweather.org's API

## Furthur Improvements

Instead of useEffect, this can be solved using,

- Context API
- React Query

Also, for CSS, we can refactor using

- TailwindCSS
- Chakra UI

The options here are endless...
